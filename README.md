# Product Comparison

VTEX Product Comparison app is responsible for collecting products (with selected SKU) and give comparison view to compare features and specifications of the product, so user can get better understanding about their needs.

The app therefore exports few store blocks expected to configure full functionality, such as `sku selector`, `comparison drawer` and `comparison list` views.
